							The Wayanad landslide refers to a tragic event that occurred in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India. This region, known for its lush green hills, dense forests, and plantations, is also prone to landslides, especially during the monsoon season. The specific landslide event you are referring to may need to be clarified in terms of date or year, as Wayanad has experienced multiple landslides over the years.
   

<h3>General Causes of Landslides in Wayanad:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Heavy Rainfall: Wayanad receives substantial rainfall during the monsoon season, typically between June and September. This excessive rain saturates the soil, reducing its cohesion and leading to landslides.</li>
        <li>Geological Factors: The district's hilly terrain, combined with loose soil and rock structures, makes it naturally susceptible to landslides.

		</li>
    <li>Deforestation and Land Use Changes: The region has seen significant deforestation and changes in land use due to agriculture and construction, which destabilizes the soil and increases the risk of landslides.</li>
    <li>Unregulated Construction: Unplanned and unregulated construction activities, particularly on steep slopes, further exacerbate the risk of landslides.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable Landslides:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1. Puthumala Landslide (2019):
		Date: August 8, 2019.
		Location: Puthumala, a village in the Meppadi region of Wayanad.
		Impact: This was one of the most devastating landslides in recent history. Heavy rains triggered a massive landslide, which buried a large portion of the village. Several houses were completely destroyed, and many people lost their lives. Rescue operations were hampered by the difficult terrain and ongoing rains. This landslide highlighted the vulnerability of Wayanad to such natural disasters.<br>
		2. Banasura Sagar Landslide (2019):
		Date: August 2019.
		Location: Near Banasura Sagar Dam.
		Impact: The Banasura Sagar region, close to the largest earthen dam in India, also witnessed landslides during the same monsoon season. These landslides caused significant damage to property and led to the evacuation of several families.</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Response and Aftermath:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Rescue Operations: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), along with local authorities, conducted extensive rescue operations, often under challenging conditions due to continuous rain and blocked roads.<br>

		Relief Camps: Thousands of people were displaced and had to be accommodated in relief camps. The government, along with various NGOs, provided food, medical care, and other essential services.<br>
		
		Rehabilitation: The government of Kerala initiated rehabilitation efforts, including financial aid for those who lost their homes and livelihood. However, the process has been slow, and many affected families continue to struggle.<br>
		
		Environmental Concerns: The landslides have raised serious concerns about the environmental degradation in Wayanad. Experts have called for stricter regulations on construction and land use in the region, along with more extensive afforestation efforts.</li>
   
</ul>
<h3>Future Risks:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Given the recurring nature of landslides in Wayanad, there is an ongoing risk of future disasters, especially with the increasing impact of climate change, which could lead to more extreme weather patterns. Sustainable development practices, early warning systems, and better land management are essential to mitigate these risks.
   
</ul>
<h3>When a hurricane is 6 hours from arriving</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you’re not in an area that is recommended for evacuation, plan to stay at home or where you are and let friends and family know where you are.
    <li>Close storm shutters, and stay away from windows. Flying glass from broken windows could injure you.
    <li>Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and open only when necessary. If you lose power, food will last longer. Keep a thermometer in the refrigerator to be able to check the food temperature when the power is restored.
    <li>Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.
</ul>
<h3>Survive DURING</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Do not drive around barricades.
    <li>If sheltering during high winds, go to a FEMA safe room, ICC 500 storm shelter, or a small, interior, windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor that is not subject to flooding.
    <li>If trapped in a building by flooding, go to the highest level of the building. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising flood water.
    <li>Listen for current emergency information and instructions.
    <li>Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery outdoors ONLY and away from windows.
    <li>Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.
    <li>Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.
</ul>
<h3>Be Safe AFTER</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Listen to authorities for information and special instructions.</li>
    <li>Be careful during clean-up. Wear protective clothing and work with someone else.</li>
    <li>Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off electricity at the main breaker or fuse box to prevent electric shock.</li>
    <li>Avoid wading in flood water, which can contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.</li>
    <li>Save phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems are often down or busy after a disaster. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends.</li>
    <li>Document any property damage with photographs. Contact your insurance company for assistance.</li>
